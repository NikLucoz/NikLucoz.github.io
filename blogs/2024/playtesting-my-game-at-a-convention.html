              <h1><span>~</span> Playtesting my game at a convention</h1>
              <p>In May, I attended ModenaPlay to playtest my first board game!</p>
              <p>Thanks to La Compagnia di Sotto Monte and the GAME Science Research Center, I had the opportunity to enter ModenaPlay as an exhibitor and showcase my board game to the public!</p>
              <p>The game is a card game about Hiking and Maize Porridge:</br> 
                  "You are a mountaineer standing at the foot of K2. At the summit, there’s a small restaurant that gives out a free portion of polenta to the first climber who reaches the top, but only on Wednesday evenings.
                  The prize is highly coveted, so you’re not alone—other penny-pinching climbers, like yourself, want to save on dinner too. Will you be the one to enjoy a feast tonight?
                  Your goal is to reach the summit before all the other fools and enjoy the free polenta right in front of their faces. During the climb, you can choose whether to be independent and rely on your own strength or sabotage the others with underhanded tricks to stop them from reaching the top (and I’m sure you’ll choose the latter).
                  Are you ready to become the king of the mountain (and of polenta)? Adventure awaits you…"
              </p>
              <p>It was an amazing experience!</p>
