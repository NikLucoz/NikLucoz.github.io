              <h1><span>~</span> First game published</h1>
              <p>My friend Tommaso and I, under the name Binary Bucket, have published our first game on Itch.io.</p>
              <p>The game is a text-based RPG:</br> 
                *In ShadowBound, you awaken in a cold, mysterious dungeon with no memory of how you got there. Armed with nothing but your wits and makeshift gear, you must navigate through dangerous corridors filled with deadly creatures, traps, and hidden secrets.  
                Explore, survive, and uncover the mysteries of this forsaken place.  
                Trapped in darkness, your only hope is escape.*
              </p>
              <p>I have learned so much about developing and prototyping, and now I’m confident enough to join my first Game Jam!</p>
